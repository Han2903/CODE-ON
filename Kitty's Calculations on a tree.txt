5)PROGRAM STATEMENT:
Kitty has a tree, , consisting of  nodes where each node is uniquely labeled from  to . Her friend Alex gave her  sets, where each set contains  distinct nodes. Kitty needs to calculate the following expression on each set:

where:

 denotes an unordered pair of nodes belonging to the set.
 denotes the number of edges on the unique (shortest) path between nodes  and .
Given  and  sets of  distinct nodes, calculate the expression for each set. For each set of nodes, print the value of the expression modulo  on a new line.

Example



The graph looks like this:

image
There are three pairs that can be created from the query set: . The distance from  to  is , from  to  is , and from  to  is .

Now do the summation:

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers, the respective values of  (the number of nodes in tree ) and  (the number of nodes in the query set).
Each of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers,  and , that describe an undirected edge between nodes  and .
The  subsequent lines define each set over two lines in the following format:

The first line contains an integer, , the size of the set.
The second line contains  space-separated integers, the set's elements.
Constraints

The sum of  over all  does not exceed .
All elements in each set are distinct.
Subtasks

Output Format

Print  lines of output where each line  contains the expression for the  query, modulo .

We perform the following calculations for  sets:

Set : Given set , the only pair we can form is , where . We then calculate the following answer and print it on a new line:
Set : Given set , we cannot form any pairs because we don't have at least two elements. Thus, we print  on a new line.

Set : Given set , we can form the pairs , , and . We then calculate the following answer and print it on a new line:
